## Add a configuration file
Create a file called `_config.yml`. Fill it with data to configure the website. There are tons of options. A web search will help you with that.

## Add content
By default your `README.md` will be used as content provider for the website. Alternatively you can create a file called `index.md` in the top level directory.
