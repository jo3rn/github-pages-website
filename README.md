## Add a configuration file
Create a file called `_config.yml`. Fill it with data to configure the website. There are tons of options. A web search will help you with that.

## Add content
By default your `README.md` will be used as content provider for the website. Alternatively you can create a file called `index.md` in the top level directory.

## Have a look at your website
It's already available! Browse to `https://<USERNAME>.github.io/<REPOSITORY-NAME>/`

In this case it is [https://jo3rn.github.io/github-pages-website/](https://jo3rn.github.io/github-pages-website/).
